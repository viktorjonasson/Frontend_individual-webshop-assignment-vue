# Web shop assigment
## Asignment brief
For the course frontend the assigment was to create a webshop and populate it with products from a dummy JSON-API. It needed to have a working shopping cart which persisted it's state in local storage.
## Project setup
For this project I decided to, for the first time, use Vue! I used Pinia for state management and Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI as CSS frameworks.
## Functionality
The focus for the app at this stage is to implement the shopping cart logic. At the moment you can add a product, change the quantity, remove one or all products.
I also played around quite a bit with the Tailwind and Daisy framworks to create something looking okay, using mostly ready-made components.
## Future
I'm intrigued to develop this further. Want I would want to do is:
- Create my own database in MySQL or MongoDB.
- Expand the shop and introduce more categories and filtering.
- Create a checkout-process.
